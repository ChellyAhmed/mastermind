## Mastrmind

A knowledge-based AI Agent developed with Python to play the game Mastermind on console.
Prepare a list of different colors and the game will try to guess them!

This project contains 3 files:
    - `mastermind 4 colors.py` : Plays the game with 4 different colors.
    - `mastermind 5 colors.py` : Plays the game with 5 different colors. Although, the imlpementation has a slightly high time complexity, resulting in longer playing duration. (I'm considering implementing it in a more optimized way)
    - `logic.py`: A file taken from Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python, containing implementation of the logical sentences and the model checking algorithm.
